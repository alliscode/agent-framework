# Notes on integrating compose

- It would be great if the LLM configuration and authentication was tested and verified before starting the long indexing process. It's painful when auth fails after all that and you need to start over.
- Docs should discuss how to clear token cache.
- Summarizing all files in the repo is very slow and seems to run serially 1 file at a time. Could the parallelism be increased here?
- Summarizing files resulted in a few errors that look like:

    ```powershell
    ERROR: Failed to get embedding response: HTTP 400 (invalid_request_error: )
    Generating source embedding(s) for '$.input' is invalid.
    ```

## Several weeks later...

Taking updates and trying to use Astred project file first as it seems like compose expects it.

To generate the compilation units for the `.astred.project.json` run these scripts from the repo root:
C#: `astred tracebld dotnet build -bl .\dotnet\`
Python: `python .\python\generate_units.py`
